# üìö Books Database Analysis (SQL Project)

This project contains a series of SQL queries to analyze a book inventory system. The data is assumed to come from a `books` table, which includes information such as book title, author, release year, number of pages, and stock quantity.

## üß† Objective

Use SQL to extract meaningful insights from the books database, including:
- Total number of books
- Yearly publication trends
- Inventory totals
- Author contributions
- Longest book information
